This little powerhouse offers a large 1" 20.2 megapixel CMOS sensor. Paired with the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, this camera will be able to handle anything you throw at it. The 4.2x optical zoom range combined with a fast shutter speed and manual mode offers the user all the settings they need to make the image perfect each and every time. The f/1.8-f/2.8 lens also has Intelligent Image Stabilization which will reduce the visibility of camera shake in the final image. Another great benefit of the G7X is the full HD 1920 x 1080 video recording abilities in 60p, as well as the 6.5 fps continuous shootng rate. Sports and child photography are easy with the G7X, making this lens a wonderful choice for mothers or sports photographers of all skill levels. Last - but not least - to be mentioned is the built-in Wi-fi connectivity. The G7X has the ability to wirelessly transfer photos and videos to mobile phones, tablets, or computers. The addition of NFC (Near Field Communication) technology allows for easy connection with Android devices - simply by tapping the two devices together makes them connect.
